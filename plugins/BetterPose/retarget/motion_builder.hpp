// MMD (VMD) -> Bip001 motion conversion, the C++ half of `tools/mmd2bip`.
//
// The Python converter in `tools/mmd2bip/mmd2bip.py` is the reference implementation and
// the only one that has been accepted in game. This port is meant to be behaviourally
// identical to it, so the rules here are deliberately literal -- every guard, threshold
// and rounding step cites the Python line it comes from, and none of them should be
// "improved" without re-measuring against a Python build on the same inputs.
//
// The port covers what a motion needs to load, play *and* look right: VMD parsing, the
// reference MMD skeleton (including its IK chains), the game's own skeleton export, the
// sparse keyframe sampler, the source model's own IK solve, the bone-name mapping, the
// output rotation math, finger chain alignment, direction correction, the hand rest
// choice, the accessory spring, the twist helpers, a track for every bone and the
// document header. Every rule here cites the Python line it comes from and none should be
// "improved" without re-measuring against the Python implementation on the same inputs.
